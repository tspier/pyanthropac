# **PyAnthropac, v0.1**

This program serves as a Python-based substitute for the 1990s-era program called Anthropac, which allows the results of freelisted ethnographic data to be analyzed by frequency of occurrence and the cognitive salience of each item individually, which is based also on its distribution within the lists themselves. The formula used to solve this is called Smith's S and is as follows:

       S = ((Î£(L-R + 1))/L)/N

In this formula, L is the number of items in each list, R is the rank of the individual item within the list, and N is the total number of lists. The sum of the list-specific salience of each item is divided by the total number of lists.

 **NOTE:** There is a small (large?) caveat here that I am neither a trained programmer nor someone with formal training in statistics. Instead, I was offering a lesson to students in our MA TESOL program on mixed-methods approaches to data collected through a variety of methods, including e.g. freelisting. In order to illustrate how this worked, I gave them each one minute to write down any vulgar words that they could think of in English. Some of these are, admittedly, more vulgar than others, but the set of lists offered a valuable set of practice data to be used and tested through the program.
